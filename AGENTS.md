# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing architecture and coding conventions.
- Keep changes focused and avoid unnecessary refactoring.
- Avoid creating new divs if theres a component.
- We are using shadcn library.
- Reuse existing components, hooks, and utilities whenever possible.
- Build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready solutions.

# Rules

- Do not preserve backward compatibility. Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers, fallbacks, or migrations.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries, tools, etc when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.
- Study how established products solve the problem before designing a solution. Adopt their proven patterns and conventions rather than inventing an approach from scratch.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility.
- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries over custom implementations.

## Code Style

- Use strict TypeScript.
- Prefer reusable, composable components.
- Keep business logic separate from UI.
- Write clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
- Remove unused code and imports.

## Before Completing a Task

- Ensure there are no TypeScript or lint errors.
- Verify that existing functionality remains unaffected.
- Summarize the changes made and highlight any assumptions.
